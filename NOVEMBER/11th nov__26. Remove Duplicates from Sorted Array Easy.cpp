/*
NAIVE APPROACH
ðŸŸ¦USING A SET
ðŸŸ¦ TC: O(nlogn) + O(n) // n for traversing in array and logn for inserting in set + n to take elements out of the set and place them in the array(in worst case 
all the elements of the array are unique)
ðŸŸ¦ SC: O(n) //(in worst case all the elements of the array are unique so u will have to store them in the set)
ðŸŸ¦MISTAKE: after u store in set ...now we know  set stores in ascending order....so we have to store the elements in nums rigth from starting index ..i.e zero
since question says TO : "Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums"
ðŸŸ¦LEARNING: set stores elements in ascending order
