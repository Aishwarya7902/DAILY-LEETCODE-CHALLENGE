/*
METHOD 1 (SOLVED ON MY OWN)ðŸ˜Ž
INTUTION :
1.Let's find the leaf value sequence for both given trees
2.Afterwards, we can compare them to see if they are equal or not.
3.To find the leaf value sequence of a tree, we use a depth first search
4.writes the node's value if it is a leaf node.
5.and then recursively explores each child.
6.This is guaranteed to visit each leaf in left-to-right order, as left-children are fully explored before right-children.

Time Complexity: O(T1+T2) , where T1,T2
are the lengths of the given trees. 

Space Complexity: O(T1+T2) , where T1,T2
are the lengths of the given trees.
