pseudo code:
1.traverse and find frequency of each character and store in a map
2.now make a vector of pairs<char,int> and store all the values of map in the vector
3.now sort this vector based on a comparator in which we sort by value of map in decreasing order
4.now traverse the vector and  add to ans string   frequency times  of given character
5.return ans

/* USING HEAP
INTUTION :

1.The idea is to use max heap with nodes containing a pair {frequency, character}
2.Since the first element of the pair is frequency, we don't need to pass a custom comparator
3. Max heap will be constructed on the basis of frequency of characters
4. the root will contain the character with maximum frequency.

TC:O(log(n)) For Construction and extraction from heap
+
O(n) For storing the frequency in hashmap.
SC: o(n)
PSEUDO CODE:
1.take a map and store frequency of each character
2.TAVERSE MAP AND STORE IT'S FREQ,CHAR IN THE MAXHEAP
 Since the first element of the pair is frequency, we don't need to pass a custom comparator
3.take each node of heap and  make a string ( count, character )
create a string containing characters repeated count times ...and then pop
4.return final ans
